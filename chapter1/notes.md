     Platforms built on top of k8s.

     
#### Platform engineering

     Besides having a dedicated paltfrom engineering team, a key cultural
     change promoted by the book *Team Topologies*, is to treat the platform itself
     as an internal product and your development teams as customers.

#### Summary

- Cloud platforms provide a set of services for teams to build their domain-specific appllications
- Platform usually offer three main features: API, dashbaord, and SDK for different teams to use whatever
fits their workflow
- Cloud platform provide pay-as-you-go model to consume hardware and software. The higher you go up the stack,
the more expensive the service will be.
- Kubernetes offers the basic building blocks to build platforms on top in a way that we can remain independent
of the underlying cloud provider and even deploy our platforms on-premises
- The CNCF promotes and fosters collaborations between open-source projects in the cloud-native space. Keeping
track of what is going on in these communities is a full-time job.
- Platform engineering on kubernetes, helps manage the complexitiy of choosing which tools and practices teams need
to adopt to be more efficient at deliverin software that will run on top of kubernetes.
